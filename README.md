# Nuance Automated Solutions Candidate Assessment

### Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to complete this candidate assessment. Please read through this entire README before attempting to complete the assignment. The following exercise is meant to test your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and to give you a better idea of the type of work you will be doing at Nuance.

NOTE: Please rename ./js/index.js.txt to ./js/index.js

### Directions

The designers at Nuance have provided you with mockups for a new pre-chat survey. This survey is intended to collect necessary information from the user prior to connecting to a chat agent. The client would like to obtain the user's full name, phone number, state, and a description of their question. All four fields are required, meaning that if they are not filled out upon form submission, the form will not submit. Additionally, the phone number must be a valid phone format. If the phone number does not follow one of the required patterns, a message should be displayed next to the input's label stating that the phone number is invalid (as seen in figure 11).

Your goal is to recreate the survey as seen in the mockups using your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Your work should be completed in the ./index.html, ./css/main.css, and ./js/index.js files. Please refer to the images located in the ./mockups/ directory for guidelines on what the survey should look like.
